# Academic Integrity Detection System 

## Overview

This project leverages concepts from Bayes Net, as learned in an AI/ML class, to create an Academic Integrity Detection System. The system aims to raise flags when potential cheating is detected in academic assignments or assessments. It's important to note that the flags raised by the system do not necessarily indicate direct code copying from online sources. False positives are expected, and the system is designed to be a tool for further investigation rather than a conclusive judgment.

## How It Works

The Academic Integrity Detection System uses Bayes Net concepts to analyze patterns and behaviors within submitted code or assignments. It takes into account various features and factors to identify potential anomalies that may suggest cheating. The system does not guarantee perfect accuracy and is susceptible to false positives. Therefore, flagged cases should be further investigated through interviews or a holistic review process.

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have the necessary Python environment and libraries installed. Check the requirements.txt file for dependencies.

2. **Input Data**: Provide the system with the relevant input data, which typically includes code submissions or academic assignments.

3. **Execution**: Run the system, and it will analyze the provided data using the Bayes Net concepts. Review the generated flags, and use them as indicators for potential cheating.

4. **Holistic Review**: Flags raised by the system should prompt further investigation. Interview individuals with flagged codes to gather additional context and assess the overall academic integrity of the submission.

## Notes

- The system is a tool to aid in detecting potential cheating but does not replace the need for human judgment and a holistic review process.
- False positives are expected, and the system should be used as a starting point for further investigation rather than a definitive conclusion.

## Disclaimer

This Academic Integrity Detection System is provided for educational and research purposes only. It is not foolproof and should be used with caution. The system does not replace the responsibility of educational institutions to uphold academic integrity through comprehensive assessment and verification processes.
